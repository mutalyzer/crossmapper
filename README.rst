----

This library provides an interface to convert (cross map) between different
HGVS numbering_ systems.

Converting between the transcript oriented c. or n. and the genomic oriented g.
numbering systems can be difficult, especially when the transcript in question
resides on the complement strand.

Please see ReadTheDocs_ for the latest documentation.
